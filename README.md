sms2droid
=========

This is a simple Ruby script to convert the SMS's in an iPhone into a format that can be used in a Android phone.

The script extracts the data from the sms.db file, which is the iPhone's sms backup file and creates an xml file which can be used by the 'SMS Backup & Restore' [android app](http://android.riteshsahu.com/apps/sms-backup-restore).


sms2droid is release under the Apache License, Version 2.0


How To

First of all you need to sync your iPhone to iTunes.

While this is happening you will need to download a couple of  application.

On your Mac
SMSExtractor (open source: http://...)

On your Android (Android Market)

Once your iPhone is done, you need to launch.... 

(more coming...)

To use the script just download it and from the command line:
