sms2droid
=========

This is a simple Ruby script to convert the SMS's in an iPhone into a format that can be used in a Android phone.

The script extracts the data from the sms.db file, which is the iPhone's sms backup file and creates an xml file which can be used by the 'SMS Backup & Restore' [android app](http://android.riteshsahu.com/apps/sms-backup-restore).
